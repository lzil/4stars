"Shoot for the Stars" won the NextJump intern project award! :D

"Shoot for the Stars" is a performance recognition/rewarding system to encourage students who do well not just in academics, but also in a variety of other activities ranging from sports, arts, public speaking, talent, through positive reinforcement. The students are rewarded stars through this system. These stars can then be redeemed by the student in a “Star Shop” online, where a student can "buy" things like 15 minutes longer recess, 1 day extension on HW, permission to wear superman cape (in the school) for a day, stickers, books, tickets to movies, candies, etc.  

This web app was built on a node.js express backend framework and uses mongodb (mongolabs) to store user data. It's in the very early stages of production as a rough mockup/rough draft of the intern outreach "Code for a Cause" project at NextJump.
